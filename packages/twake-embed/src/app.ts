// The app side of the contract: what an app framed by TwakeSpace does.
//
// The page and its frames share one browser history, and TwakeSpace owns it:
// in a frame the app never adds an entry and never navigates its own
// document after its boot. `syncHistory` turns `pushState` into
// `replaceState`, reports every change of the frame's URL, and applies the
// `load` and `navigate` messages of TwakeSpace. Measured in Chromium, Firefox
// and WebKit: a removed frame keeps its entries as dead Back presses in
// Chromium and WebKit, and a frame that only replaces adds none.
//
// The app does not need to know where TwakeSpace is: TwakeSpace greets the
// frame (`twake-embed:hello`) on each of its loads and whenever the app says
// it is listening (`twake-embed:ready`, since the app may boot after the
// frame's load), and the app answers the origin that greeted it. Only a page the app's `frame-ancestors` allows can
// be that parent, so the parent is trusted by construction: the header stays
// mandatory. `hostOrigins` restricts the hosts further, when given.
